For convenience, we provide libSBML, the SBMLToolbox, and glpk_mex in external/toolboxes for Mac OS X 10.6 (64-bit), GNU/Linux Ubuntu 10.0 (64-bit), and Microsoft Windows 7 (64-bit).  If you do not wish to use these items please delete the directories.  If you require these external libraries for other architectures please ask google or visit their respective websites.

Cobra_Install_Path is the path to the top level directory for the COBRA Toolbox
Update Shared Library Path â€” Mac OS X and GNU/Linux Only
    -Mac OS: DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=Cobra_Install_Path/external/toolboxes/SBMLToolbox_3.1.2/toolbox/
    -GNU/Linux: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=Cobra_Install_Path/external/toolboxes/SBMLToolbox_3.1.2/toolbox/

From MATLAB, run
  initCobraToolbox


NOTE: If you do not have gurobi_mex and tomlab installed on your machine, you will get some warnings and some errors.  The COBRA Toolbox will try to use glpk if it cannot find gurobi for LP / MILP.  To solve any QP problems you need tomlab.

After running initCobraToolbox, run
  testAll
to see what functions will work with your current configuration.  Note, it is likely that one or more functions will not work unless you have both gurobi and tomlab installed.
