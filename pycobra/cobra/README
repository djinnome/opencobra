cobra for python is under development at the moment and is not supported.  If you're interested have a look around, but please know that any questions posted to the mailing lists or e-mailed to us will be ignored.  

We should be posting an official announcement in the near future at which time we'll detail how to get help.

If you're really interested in using this early on then please note that it has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.6 and Ubuntu GNU/Linux 10.0.4.  As things are, a number of modules must be installed on your system (see INSTALL) to use this package, and some of them are not currently (or easily) compatible with Microsoft Windows.
