20110613:
  To speed up the reverse look up from a (Metabolite|Gene) to a Reaction, these items have a _reaction attribute and Reaction has been modified to update this attributed based on addition and removal of items from the Reaction.  cobra.Reaction.(metabolites|genes) have been renamed cobra.Reaction._(metabolites|genes) to reflect the fact that directly modifying them is no longer a good idea.
20110610: To speed things up a number of changes have been made:
  1) When a cobra.(Reaction|Metabolite|Gene) is added to a cobra.Model it points to its container with a _model attribute.
  2) When a cobra.Reaction is added to a cobra.Model, its metabolites and genes point to elements in cobra.Model.(metabolites|genes).
  3) cobra.Reaction.(metabolites|genes) are dictionaries {cobra.Object: stoichiometric_coefficient}.
  4) cobra.Metabolite.coefficient is removed to allow multiple Reactions to use the same Metabolite when in a Model which speeds up Model creation and shrinks the memory footprint.
  5) cobra.manipulation.convert_rule_to_boolean_rule is removed.  The parsing of rules is offloaded to cobra.Reaction
  6) cobra.Model._rules is removed.
  7) cobra.Model.update_stoichiometric_matrix() is present in an simplistic incarnation.
  8) cobra.mlab is still broken.
  9) update Object.__getstate__ to deference _model
