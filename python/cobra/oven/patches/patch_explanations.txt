DictList_tab_complete  
Allows tab completion on a DictList, such as model.reactions.PG<TAB> will
autocomplete to model.reactions.PGI

convert_back_to_reversible  
Adds a function to cobra.manipulation.modify which can undo the changes made by convert_to_irreversible.
   STATUS: 04 June 2012: A different method has been applied 



mlab
Make improvements to the mlab module. MATLAB commands can be called using cobra.matlab Creates a function init_matlab_toolbox, which calls the initCobraToolbox function in MATLAB and scans through the cobra matlab functions for faster use.
   STATUS: 04 June 2012: Applied

store_solution_in_model 
Store the flux of the reaction in the reaction object itself. This allows commands like:
[r for r in reactions if r.x > 2.0 and r.id.startswith("EX_")]
model.reactions.query(lambda r : r.x > 2.0 and r.id.startswith("EX_"), None)
   STATUS: 04 June 2012: This degrades performance when running lots of simulations (FVA, double deletion, ...).  Possibly add
as an option to the optimize call, a separate function, or in a solver-specific fashion to minimize performance issues.

test_directory_improvement
Defines platform-independent paths to test files
