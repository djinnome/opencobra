DictList_tab_complete
Allows tab completion on a DictList, such as model.reactions.PG<TAB> will
autocomplete to model.reactions.PGI

convert_back_to_reversible
Adds a function to cobra.manipulation.modify which can undo the changes made by convert_to_irreversible.

mlab
Make improvements to the mlab module. MATLAB commands can be called using cobra.matlab Creates a function init_matlab_toolbox, which calls the initCobraToolbox function in MATLAB and scans through the cobra matlab functions for faster use.

store_solution_in_model
Store the flux of the reaction in the reaction object itself. This allows commands like:
[r for r in reactions if r.x > 2.0 and r.id.startswith("EX_")]
model.reactions.query(lambda r : r.x > 2.0 and r.id.startswith("EX_"), None)

test_directory_improvement
Defines platform-independent paths to test files
