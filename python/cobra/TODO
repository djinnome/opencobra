-Create setup / install scripts.

-Improve parallel performance.

-Add time out parameter to optimize function.

-Create testing modules with unittest. 

-It will probably be faster to access arrays and vectors for repeated simulations than to use the objects.  If that's the case then revert the relevant portions of the flux_analysis/ modules to using the vectors and matrices.

-Fix flux_analysis.moma
-Fix topology/reporter_metabolites.py

-Implement MILP support for running strain design algorithms.

-Implement pFBA, optKnock, and optStrain.  Start with a wrapper to the COBRA Toolbox, then move to a native implementation.

-Add example code for: gene deletions, flux variability analysis, combining reactions, ...
